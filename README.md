# CNN_for_Covid_Detection
convolution neural network for Posetive COVID detection
1- Create artificial images with data augmentation including (flipping, histogram equalization, rotation,
translation, shearing and etc.) and add them in the dataset.
2- Display the total number of dataset color images after the data augmentation step and separate 80% of the
dataset for training dataset and 20% for test dataset.
3- Create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) according to the following structure
